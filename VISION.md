# PowerTrader AI - Vision & Philosophy

**Version:** 3.3.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-25

## The Ultimate Goal
To create the world's most advanced, autonomous, and accessible crypto trading system. PowerTrader AI bridges the gap between institutional-grade algorithmic trading and user-friendly DeFi interactions.

## Core Pillars

1.  **Hybrid Intelligence:** Combining traditional Quant strategies (MACD, RSI, Grid) with deep learning (LSTM, kNN) to validate signals and adapt to changing market conditions.
2.  **Universal Connectivity:** Seamlessly trading across Centralized Exchanges (Binance, Coinbase) and Decentralized Protocols (Uniswap V3) from a single interface.
3.  **Risk-First Architecture:** Prioritizing capital preservation through dynamic position sizing, correlation analysis, and automated trailing stops.
4.  **Web3 Native:** Allowing users to connect their own wallets for non-custodial portfolio tracking and interaction.

## Architecture

*   **Frontend:** React (Vite) + TailwindCSS. Responsive, real-time, and mobile-ready.
*   **Backend:** Node.js + TypeScript. Event-driven architecture handling market data streams and execution logic.
*   **AI Engine:** TensorFlow.js (Node) for model training and inference.
*   **Data:** SQLite for local persistence, minimizing infrastructure costs.

## Future Direction (v4.0+)

*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Moving from "Prediction" to "Action" agents.
*   **Social Sentiment:** Integrating Twitter/Reddit analysis.
*   **Mobile App:** Native iOS/Android experience via React Native.
